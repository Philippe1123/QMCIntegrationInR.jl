```

First cd to
```command
cd .julia/packages/QMCIntegrationInR
```

To run the simulation
```julia
include("IntRQMC_D_MultiLevel_v2.jl")
```



IntRQMC_D_MultiLevel_v4.jl   ->   Mapping of function to the unit cube  with Sobol' sequences and HKKN lattice sequences

IntRQMC_D_MultiLevel_v5.jl   ->   Integration of the function in R with Sobol' sequences and HKKN lattice sequences

IntRQMC_D_MultiLevel_v6.jl   ->   Improved mapping of function to the unit cube (see paper) with Sobol' sequences and HKKN lattice sequences

IntRQMC_D_MultiLevel_v7.jl   ->   Integration of the function in R with Niedereiter Xing sequences and HKKN lattice sequences
